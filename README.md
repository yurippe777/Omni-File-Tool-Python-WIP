# Advanced-Up-To-Date-Pokemon-Filter
This program allows you to easily sort through Pokemon by types and by abilities, thereby allowing you to better prepare a team that matches your needs. 
To run this program, place the pokemon.py within Pycharm, and install the libraries imported at the top. Then place the two csv files within the same project directory.
If a release is requested, then I can make one. The program can be seen in the GIF below.
